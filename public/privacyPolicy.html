				<p class="ps-lg-5 pe-lg-5 ms-lg-5 me-lg-5">The Website uses "cookie" and "web beacon" technology.
					Cookies
					are tiny text files that are stored on our website as you browse, to help track your use of our site
					and
					to personalize your journey. If you return to the website, the server can call the information from
					the
					cookies stored on your computer to tailor your experience of the site. Web beacons are used in
					combination with cookies to help website operators understand how visitors interact with their
					websites.
					A web beacon is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on
					a
					site. As opposed to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are
					embedded
					invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. The use of
					a
					web beacons allows the site to measure the actions of the visitor opening the page that contains the
					web
					beacon. It makes it easier to follow and record the activities of a recognized browser, such as the
					path
					of pages visited at a website. InstaGrab uses the information provided by web beacons to develop a
					better
					understanding of how the Website's visitors use the Website, and to facilitate those visitors'
					interactions with the Website.

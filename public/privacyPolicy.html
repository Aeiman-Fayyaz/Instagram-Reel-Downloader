			known as environmental variables) to facilitate your use of the Website and the Services enabled thereby.
			When you browse the Internet, your Internet browser (such as Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, or Microsoft
			Internet Explorer) automatically transmits some information to InstaGrab every time you access content on
			one
			of our internet domains. Examples of such information include the URL of the particular Web page you

			the DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be
			tracked.

		<p class="ps-lg-5 pe-lg-5 ms-lg-5 me-lg-5">Our Website also may contain links to other third-party websites.
			InstaGrab is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. We encourage you to
			carefully read the privacy statement of any website you visit. InstaGrab may make third party applications
			available to you through the Website or Services. The information collected by InstaGrab when you enable a
